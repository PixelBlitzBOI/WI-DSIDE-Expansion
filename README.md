## Data Formats

W.I Supports four built in data types:
- Genric Xmls (Commonly Supported in game engines)
- Sparrow V1-2 (Default FNF Format)
- Packer (Week 6 TXT Format)
- Json Format (HASH and Array Supported)

[Paths](https://github.com/lunarcleint/Wednesdays-Infidelity/blob/master/source/util/Paths.hx) has a easy function to get frames based on a [Data Type](https://github.com/lunarcleint/Wednesdays-Infidelity/blob/master/source/data/DataType.hx) value. [getAtlasFromData(key:String, data:DataType, ?library:String)](https://github.com/lunarcleint/Wednesdays-Infidelity/blob/master/source/util/Paths.hx#L342).

Also [Character.hx](https://github.com/lunarcleint/Wednesdays-Infidelity/blob/master/source/gameObjects/Character.hx) has a data type paramter that can easily be edited.

****NOTE:****
You have to click reload image for the data type to update
Sometimes it will crash when you do that so you should just add to to the Json

### Scaling Sprite Sheets

Download [Free Texture Packer](http://free-tex-packer.com/) and Install it.

Now you want to export your adobe animate animations as a PNG Sequence, ****make sure your DPI is 72****.

Then put all of it into [Free Texture Packer](http://free-tex-packer.com/) with these settings (you can change these to your liking):

After you've made the sprite sheet look good, export the sprite sheet.

## New Charting Events
**(By Pixel :D)**

I've added some new events for much easier charting! Now you won't have to do 1 hour of unsuccessful coding using script.hx (even though i literally did that for half the mod XD).
**Here are the new events I've added:**
- camGame On
- Add Cinematic Bars (High)
- Add Cinematic Bars (Low)
- Remove Cinematic Bars
- Hud Fade Out
- Hud Fade Out (Keep notes and healthbar)
- Hud Fade In (Only notes and healthbar)
- Hud Fade In
- blackFuck Flash (PRIVATE_BUILD tag replacement for Flash Black)

**NOTE: there's literally no difference between Add Cinematic Bars (High) and (Low). Why? Because it's broken and I can't fix it! :D**
